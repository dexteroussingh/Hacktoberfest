Hi, my name is Ayush Rawal, I've been working with web technologies - React, Angular, Node, PWAs, and SPAs for around a year, though I've also dabbled in other technologies ike machine learning, blockchain (esp smart contracts), game development, and AR

Recently I got selected for an internship at Amazon which I'll be joining this summer. Currently I'm working on a few projects - some of which are web apps, one about facial recoginition; learning aws; and doing my courses at openclassrooms and datacamp whose scholarship I earned from facebook developer circles
